# Privacy Policy — Periodt

Last updated: 24 September 2025

Periodt is a privacy‑first Android app that works entirely on the device. This policy explains what information is processed, how it is stored, and what choices are available.

## Summary
- No account or cloud services. All data stays on the device.
- No ads and no analytics/trackers.
- Optional reminders are scheduled locally.
- Data at rest is encrypted.

## Data the app process locally
- Cycle entries and app settings entered by the user are stored locally to provide core features like predictions and reminders.
- The app does not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, location, contacts, device identifiers, advertising IDs, or usage analytics.
- The app does not share data with third parties.

## Storage and Security
- Local-only storage in the app’s private sandbox.
- Encryption at rest via an encrypted database (SQLCipher). The encryption key is generated per install and protected by Android Keystore.

## Permissions
- POST_NOTIFICATIONS (Android 13+): Used only to display optional reminders.
- RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED: Used to reschedule reminders after device restart.
- No Internet permission is requested.

## Data Retention and Deletion
- Data remains on the device until the user deletes it or uninstalls the app.
- Uninstalling the app removes the app’s local data.
- If a “Reset/Delete data” option is provided in‑app, using it erases locally stored entries and settings.

## Children’s Privacy
- Periodt is intended for a general audience. If a parent or guardian wishes to remove information entered on a child’s device, uninstalling the app will delete local data on that device.

## Changes to This Policy
- The “Last updated” date will change when this policy is revised. Material updates will be reflected in the repository and, where appropriate, highlighted in the app.
